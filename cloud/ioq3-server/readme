Progress notes:
  Was able to setup dante proxy (check prev commits).
  A simple HTTP server would serve requests over private
  IP, from frankfurt, just fine.

  However neither standard q3 nor ioq3 support SOCKS properly.
  Multiple mentions of this around the interned, no one was able to get it working.
  This will need some work.
  ID uses their own protocol for q3 that is supposedly compatible with SOCKS5.
